Thanks for wanting to contribute to Dasharr !

## Quickstart :

- clone the repo
- install the frontend and backend deps (in the `frontend` and `backend` directories)
- start the backend : `go run server.go`
- start the frontend : `npm run dev`
- start coding !

## What to do ?

Looking for something to do ?

- Many indexers are still to be added
- Some indexer logos are missing
- Task tracker : https://github.com/users/FrenchGithubUser/projects/1

If you decide to take a task from the task tracker, please open and issue about it, and say that you are on it.

Don't hesitate to get in touch on `#dev` on the discord server (link in the README)
